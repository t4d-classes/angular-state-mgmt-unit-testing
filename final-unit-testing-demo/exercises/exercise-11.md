# Exercise 11

Instructions: Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** In the App module, create a new component named Item List. Item List should produce output that looks like this:

```html
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
  <li>item 4</li>
</ul>
```

The list of items should be passed in as an input and the list should be a list of strings.

**Requirement 2.** Attempt to code a unit test first then code the component. If you cannot do this, then code the component then the unit test. What needs to be unit tested?


Ensure it all works, and please raise your hand when you are done.
