# Exercise 5

Instructions: Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Implement two additional math operations: multiply and divide.

**Requirement 2.** Display a history of math operations beneath the buttons. For each history entry display a unique id, the name of the math operation, and the value of the input field.

**Requirement 3.** The history should be updated for all math operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

**Requirement 4.** For each history entry, display a delete button. When the button is clicked, remove the entry from the history list. Do not update the result.

Ensure it all works, and please raise your hand when you are done.
