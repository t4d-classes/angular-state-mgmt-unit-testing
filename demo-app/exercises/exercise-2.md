# Exercise 2

Instructions: Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

## Steps

**Step 1.** In the User Accounts service, initialize the state with an array of 4 users.

**Step 2.** Place a button on each row of the registered users table. When the button is clicked, mark the user as archived.

**Step 3.** Add a button above the table that will show/hide the archived users. Non-archived users should always be shown.

**Step 4.** Add a component above the register user component that shows how many users are displayed in the table.

App Component Template:
```html
<app-users-displayed></app-users-displayed>
<app-register-user></app-register-user>
<app-registered-users></app-registered-users>
```

**Step 5.** Ensure it all works, and please raise your hand when you are done.
